# Sebastian's Terminal

This project is a terminal-like interface designed to execute commands and display outputs. It simulates a command-line interface (CLI) where users can enter commands and receive responses.

## Overview

The terminal interface consists of an input field where users can enter commands and an output field that displays the results of executed commands. Each command corresponds to a specific function that generates output in the terminal.

## How to Access
- Project is currently being hosted on my school's Linux Server. Here is the link: [Go to Website](https://codd.cs.gsu.edu/~srodriguez35/terminal_site/terminal.html).
  
## Features

- **Command Execution:** Users can enter commands (e.g., `whoami`, `linkedin`, `github`) in the input field and receive corresponding output.
- **Output Display:** The output field displays the results of the executed commands.
- **Scrolling Output:** The output field automatically scrolls to show the latest output after each command.

## Usage

1. **Enter Command:** Type a command in the input field and press `Enter` to execute it.
2. **View Output:** The output field will display the result of the executed command.
3. **Command History:** Previous commands entered by the user are displayed in the terminal.
